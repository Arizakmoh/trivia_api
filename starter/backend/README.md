## 1. Getting Started

### 1.1. Installing Dependencies


#### 1.1.1. Python 3.8

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)


#### 1.1.2. Virtual Environment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virtual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
also, checkout [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/), as it's a great package to manage virtual environments.

Example in windows  : 
set virtual enviroment ==> cmd then go your project folder

py -m venv env

To Activate virtual enviroment

env\Scripts\activate



#### 1.1.3. PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by navigating to the `/backend` directory and running:

```
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

to upgrade exist Dependencies

pip install --upgrade SQLAlchemy 
```
or
```
bash
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.


#### 1.1.4. Project Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

## 2. setting up

Follow these setup instructions to get the project up and running

### 2.1. setting up the environment variables
Before running the project, you should set some environment variables, preferably in your ```.env``` file.
Below are the environment variables for the project. You can put them in a `.env` file in the root of your virtual environment, or set the variables in the terminal as follows:
```
bash
export FLASK_CONFIG=development

-- windows
use set instead export
```

- `FLASK_CONFIG`: Specifies a configuration class for the app. possible choices are development, testing, or production. If not set, the app will run in the development environment by default.  
E.G: `FLASK_CONFIG = 'development'`
    - `development`: Start the app in the development environment. `FLASK_ENV` will be set to `development`. which detects file changes and restarts the server automatically.
    - `testing`: Same as development, but with `testing` set to `True`. This helps in automated testing.
    - `production`: Start the app in the production environment, with `FLASK_ENV` set to `production`, and `debug` and `testing` set to `False`.
- `SECRET_KEY`: Set your secret_key which is your data's encryption key. This key should be random. Ideally, you shouldn't even know what it is.  
E.g.: `SECRET_KEY = 'asogfkbir159hjrigjsq109487glrk54b2j5a'  
If not set, `SECRET_KEY` will fall back to the string `HackMePleaseLol`.
- `DATABASE_URI` : Set the database uri for SQLAlchemy for the different configuration classes  
```
# Production DB URI
DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://postgres:123456@localhost:5432/trivia'

```

### 2.2. Database Setup
With Postgres running and our trivia database created, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:
```
bash
psql trivia_dev < trivia.psql
```
notice that I've used the `trivia_dev` database, as I want to run the app in the development environment. For more information, checkout the [PostgreSQL Docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/backup-dump.html)

## 3. Running the server

From within the `backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```
bash
python wsgi.py
```

## 4. API Reference

### 4.1. General
- Base URL: this app is hosted locally under the port 5000. The API base URL is `http://localhost:5000/api/v1`
- Authentication: this app doesn't require any authentication or API tokens.
- You must set the header: `Content-Type: application/json` with every request.

### 4.2. error Handlers

if any errors accured, the API will return a json object in the following format:

```
{
    "success": False,
    "error": 404,
    "message": "no data found"
}
```

The following errors will be reported:

- 400: `bad request`
- 404: `no data found`
- 405: `method not allowed`
- 422: `unprocessible`

```

## 5. Testing

The app uses `unittest` for testing all functionalities. Create a testing database and store the URI in the `TEST_DATABASE_URI` environment.
To run the tests, run
```
bash
# if exists, drop the testing database and create it again
dropdb trivia
createdb trivia
# restore the trivia dump file to the testing database
psql trivia < trivia.psql
# finally, from the `backend` directory, run
python test_flaskr.py
```
